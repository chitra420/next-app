                            <p>Respecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li> We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
                                <li> We don’t keep your personal information longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.</li>
                                <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.</li>
                                <li>We don’t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.</li>
                                <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information.</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the manner in which GyanOK.com handles the information and personal data which You have provided to Us and which enables Us to be able to effectively manage the relationship which You have with Us.
                                This Policy applies to Our websites, applications, products and/or services that link to this policy or do not have a separate privacy policy (hereinafter referred to as “Our Services”). This Policy is intended to give You a better understanding of the data We collect, the reason why We collect such data, the manner in which We process this data, the entities with whom We share the said personal data, Your rights in relation to the collection, processing and sharing of such data and any other pertinent matter relating to privacy and security.
                                Any personal data You will provide or which We already hold will be processed in line with and in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. Any and all information will be provided through any of the GyanOK websites (“The Website”), the designated telephone numbers or any other means which GyanOK may make available from time to time.
                            </p>
                            <p>By reading this Policy You understand and acknowledge that Your personal data may be processed in the manner set out in this Policy. If You do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy please do not use the Website or otherwise provide Us with Your Personal Data.</p>
                            <p>
                                Any references in this Policy to <strong>“GyanOK”,</strong> “Us”, “We” or “Our” relate to the Data Controller, namely, Applaud Web Media Private Limited, registered address at VK Tower, Kunjapuri Vihar, Haridwar bypass road, Uttarakhand and which is the owner of the website https://www.GyanOK.com and/or any sub-website and/or associated domains (and/or sub-domains) of https://www.GyanOK.com.
                            </p>
                            <h3>PROCESSING ON THE BASIS OF OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</h3>
                            <p>A legitimate interest exists when We have a business or commercial reason upon which personal data will be processed. In such a case We undertake to protect any and all of Your personal data and the manner in which such data is processed and to ensure that such processing would not be unfair to You or to Your interest.</p>
                            <p>If and when We decide to process Your personal data on the basis of legitimate interest, We will inform You of such, what said legitimate interest are and provide a process whereby You will be able to raise any questions and/or objections which You way have in relation to such processing. It is important to note that GyanOK is not obliged to stop processing if the grounds for processing over-ride Your right to object.</p>
                            <h3>PROCESSING ON THE BASIS OF YOUR CONSENT</h3>
                            <p>Consent is not the only ground we may be permitted or obliged to rely on to process Your personal data. We will only process personal data on the basis of Your consent where we cannot or otherwise choose not to rely on any ulterior legal ground (such as compliance with a legal obligation or legitimate interest). Where we process Your personal data on the basis of Your consent, you shall have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and in the same manner as it had been previously provided by Yourself. In the case that You exercise Your right to withdraw consent, we would then determine whether we are able (or obliged) to process Your personal data on the basis of any other legal ground other than consent. If this is the case We will notify You accordingly. Any such withdrawal of Your consent will not invalidate any processing operations carried out prior to You having withdrawn Your consent.</p>
                            <h3>DATA RETENTION POLICY</h3>
                            <p>Any and all Personal Data GyanOK will keep will be protected in the best way possible and will only be used for purposes which are compatible with the applicable Data Protection Laws as well as any other applicable laws. GyanOK will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary (taking into consideration the purpose for which it was originally obtained). The criteria We use to determine what is ‘necessary’ depends on the particular Personal Data in question and the specific relationship We have with You (including its duration).</p>
                            <p>Generally, Our normal practice is to determine whether there is/are any specific Indian law(s) (for example tax or corporate laws) permitting or even obliging Us to keep certain Personal Data for a certain period of time (in which case We will keep the Personal Data for the maximum period indicated by any such law). For example, any data that can be deemed to be ‘accounting records’ must be kept for ten (10) years. We may also subject to a number of rules specific to the Gaming sector.</p>
                            <p>We would also have to determine whether there are any laws and/or contractual provisions that may be invoked against Us by You and/or third parties and if so, what the prescriptive periods for such actions are (this is usually five (5) years). In the latter case, We will keep any relevant Personal Data that We may need to defend Ourselves against any claim(s), challenge(s) or other such action(s) by You and/or third parties for such time as is necessary.</p>
                            <p>Where Your Personal Data is no longer required by Us, We will either securely delete or anonymise the Personal Data in question.</p>
                            <p>Failure to provide Your Personal Data may prevent GyanOK from meeting its legal and regulatory obligations, fulfilling its contractual obligations and rendering and/or performing the necessary services needed to satisfactorily manage and maintain Your account. Therefore, failure to provide the necessary personal data may lead to GyanOK being unable to provide You with certain products and/or services.</p>

                            <h3>PROCESSING ON THE BASIS OF CONSENT</h3>
                            <p>For the avoidance of all doubt, We would like to point out that in those limited cases where We cannot or choose not to rely on another legal ground (for example, Our legitimate interests), We will process Your Personal Data on the basis of Your consent.</p>
                            <p>In those cases where We process on the basis of Your consent (which We will never presume but which We shall have obtained in a clear and manifest manner from You), YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME and this, in the same manner as You shall have provided it to Us.</p>
                            <p>Should You exercise Your right to withdraw Your consent at any time (by writing to Us at the physical or email address below), We will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis exists for processing Your Personal Data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which We are subject) where We would be legally authorised (or even obliged) to process Your Personal Data without needing Your consent and if so, notify You accordingly.</p>
                            <p>When We ask for such Personal Data, You may always decline, however should You decline to provide Us with necessary data that We require to provide requested services, We may not necessarily be able to provide You with such services (especially if consent is the only legal ground that is available to Us).</p>
                            <p>
                                Just to clarify, consent is not the only ground that permits Us to process Your Personal Data. In the last preceding section above We pointed out the various grounds that We rely on when processing Your Personal Data for specific purposes.
                            </p>

                            <p>Moreover, We shall accept no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the security of Your data while in transit through the internet unless Our responsibility results explicitly from a law having effect in India.</p>

                            </p>

                            <p>We may use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new services offered by GyanOK and its partners that we think you may find valuable. GyanOK may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails, although GyanOK reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.
                            </p>
                            <p>Profile information is used by GyanOK primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to other users. In some cases, other users may be able to supplement your profile, including by submitting comments.</p>
                            <p>GyanOK may use aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, for any purpose. This data may be used by GyanOK and shared with third parties in any manner.</p>

                            <h3>Sharing Your Personally-Identifiable Information with Third Parties</h3>
                            <p>GyanOK shares your personally-identifiable information only in limited circumstances where GyanOK believes such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally required or, permitted by you.</p>
                            <b>For example:</b>
                            <p>We may provide personally-identifiable information to service providers who help us bring you the Service, such as hosting the Service at a co-location facility or sending email updates. In connection with these operations, our service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information for use for a limited time. Where we utilize service providers for the processing of any of personally-identifiable information, we implement reasonable contractual protections limiting the use of that personally-identifiable information to the provision of services to GyanOK.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we may work with partners who use mobile SDKs, including the OneSignal Messaging SDK, to passively collect information (collectively, “SDK Information”), which generally helps us deliver personalized notifications. This data may also be used to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers for the purposes of customizing ads or content. Depending on the permissions granted to this application, this information may include personally identifiable information (PII) including your e-mail address. This information may also include precise location (i.e. GPS-level data) or WiFi information, apps you have installed and enabled, and your mobile identifier (e.g., Android Advertising ID).</p>
